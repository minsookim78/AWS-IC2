1. A solutions architect is designing a solution where users will be directed to a backup static error page if the primary website is unavailable. The primary website's DNS records are hosted in Amazon Route 53 where their domain is pointing to an Application Load Balancer (ALB).
Which configuration should the solutions architect use to meet the company's needs while minimizing changes and infrastructure overhead?

A. Point a Route 53 alias record to an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the ALB as one of its origins. Then, create custom error pages for the distribution.
B. Set up a Route 53 active-passive failover configuration. Direct traffic to a static error page hosted within an Amazon S3 bucket when Route 53 health checks determine that the ALB endpoint is unhealthy.
C. Update the Route 53 record to use a latency-based routing policy. Add the backup static error page hosted within an Amazon S3 bucket to the record so the traffic is sent to the most responsive endpoints.
D. Set up a Route 53 active-active configuration with the ALB and an Amazon EC2 instance hosting a static error page as endpoints. Route 53 will only send requests to the instance if the health checks fail for the ALB.

B

Which combination of AWS services are MOST cost-effective for this solution? (Choose two.)

A. Amazon EC2
B. AWS Lambda
C. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
D. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

D+E - The sentence says that they wants to move towards near-real tiem data processing.
This means that the ingestion of data, click streams are injected into Kinesis Data Firehose which sends the data toward Kinesis Data analytics to business analysis.
I skip lambda because in order to send the click streams to analytics takes more effort to send to KinesisData Analytics. The question say combination, and natural combination of kinesis data anlytics is with kinesis firehose.
If the statement where real-time should be data streams instead near real time of kinesis firehose. So summarizing:
A) Amazon EC2 - expensive
B) AWS lambda - non minimal effort
C) Kinesis Data Stream - Non near real time
D) Kinesis Data Firehose- By default the manner to ingest data - CORRECT
E) Kinesis Data Analytics- We need perform analytics - CORRECT
